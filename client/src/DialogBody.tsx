                        This Dashboard displays fight statistics for two HEMA longsword fencers based on HEMA Ratings.

                        I made it since I felt that the existing <Link href="https://hemaratings.com/organizertools/titanclasher/">Titan Clasher</Link> lacked some essential features
                            like the information if both fencers have faced each other and how that went. Also because it was fun.

                    <Typography paragraph>
                        To use it set the fencer IDs on the left and right,
                            e.g. if the URL to the HEMA Ratings profile is <Link href="https://hemaratings.com/fighters/details/10/">https://hemaratings.com/fighters/details/10/</Link> the id to use is 10.

                        Currently this only works for comparing open longsword.
